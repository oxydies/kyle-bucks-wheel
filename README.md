### Prerequisites
1. Create a free account at [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Install Vercel CLI (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

### Method 1: Deploy via GitHub (Recommended)

1. **Create a GitHub repository:**
   - Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
   - Upload all the files from this project

2. **Connect to Vercel:**
   - Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
   - Click "Import Project"
   - Select your GitHub repository
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Add Vercel KV Storage:**
   - After deployment, go to your project dashboard on Vercel
   - Click on the "Storage" tab
   - Click "Create Database"
   - Select "KV" (Redis)
   - Give it a name like "kyle-bucks-db"
   - Click "Create"
   - Vercel will automatically connect it to your project

4. **Done!** Your app is now live at `https://your-project.vercel.app`

### Method 2: Deploy via Vercel CLI

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Login to Vercel:**
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```
   - Follow the prompts
   - Choose "yes" to link to existing project or create new one

4. **Add Vercel KV:**
   - Go to your project on vercel.com
   - Follow step 3 from Method 1 above

5. **Redeploy with storage:**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Method 3: Drag & Drop (Easiest but Limited)

1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Drag and drop the entire project folder
3. Add KV storage (see step 3 from Method 1)
4. Redeploy from the Vercel dashboard

## Important: Setting Up Vercel KV

**YOU MUST ADD VERCEL KV STORAGE** or the app won't work! Here's why:
- The app stores all prizes and player balances in Vercel KV (Redis)
- Without it, the API endpoints will fail

**To add KV after deployment:**
1. Go to your project on vercel.com
2. Click "Storage" tab
3. Click "Create Database"
4. Choose "KV"
5. Name it (e.g., "kyle-bucks-db")
6. Click "Create"
7. Vercel automatically redeploys with the database connected

## Usage

### For Players:
1. Go to the URL (e.g., `https://kyle-bucks.vercel.app`)
2. Enter your name
3. Check your balance
4. Spin if you have 20+ Kyle Bucks!

### For Admin (You):
1. Click the "üëë Admin" button

## Customization

### Change Admin Password
Edit `/api/admin/login.js`:
